        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Ambrose Ojimba. My journey into web development began with
          a deep curiosity for how the digital world works. I was fascinated by
          how simple lines of code could transform into beautiful, interactive
          websites. This curiosity quickly grew into a passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a dedicated, self-taught Web Developer continuously learning and
          building projects that enhance real-world digital experiences. As my
          profile says, I love "turning concepts into code and designs into
          experiences, one pixel and one function at a time."

        <h2>Confidence Level</h2>
        <p>
          I’m currently building my confidence in JavaScript and React. Though I
          sometimes struggle with the deeper logic, I’m committed to learning,
          practicing, and mastering how it all works behind the scenes. Every
          line of code is a step toward improvement.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          You once struggled with understanding JavaScript and React, the logic
          felt confusing and the concepts seemed out of reach. But you didn’t
          give up. You kept learning, practicing, and pushing through the
          challenges. Remember this: progress takes patience, and every bug you
          fix, every concept you grasp, is proof that you’re growing into the
          developer you’re meant to be.

        <h2>Extra Thought</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that a great website is more than just code; it's an
          experience. I am committed to writing clean, efficient, and
          maintainable code. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate,
          learn from others, and contribute to meaningful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me playing football, swimming, or
          listening to music.
